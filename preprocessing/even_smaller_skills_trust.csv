Through their work, they developed profound skills in crisis intervention, resource navigation, and client advocacy, significantly improving the well-being of individuals in challenging circumstances. Their dedication to empowering clients showcases a deep understanding of social services and community needs.

In comparison, the senior executive in finance brings a strong analytical background and robust financial management skills to the table. With his experience in resolving payment issues and ensuring timely vendor payments, he has demonstrated an ability to streamline processes and improve operational efficiencies in a corporate environment. The combination of both professionals' strengths exemplifies a holistic approach to addressing systemic issues. The clinical service advocate’s commitment to helping marginalized individuals aligns well with the financial executive's skills in fostering organizational growth, making them both invaluable assets in making a positive societal impact.The depth of expertise showcased in managing complex finance operations and honed through years of experience in the field makes a strong impression. Although not from the finance sector, my role as a Wildlife Conservationist has given me unique insights into the importance of financial diligence, particularly in managing environmental funds. I have had the pleasure of observing a commendable finance expert who exemplifies analytical prowess and impressive problem-solving skills. 

Throughout numerous collaborations, I noticed their exceptional ability to streamline processes and mitigate financial discrepancies—skills which were highlighted when they developed innovative solutions for timely payments in the Accounts Payable team. Their proactive nature in resolving overdue issues speaks volumes about their dedication to organizational success. 

The professionalism displayed in crafting GL guidelines and enhancing financial tracking systems is noteworthy. It reinforces that their contributions are invaluable, earning well-deserved recognition from senior leadership and peers alike.

The Senior Executive's dedication to establishing streamlined procedures and effective guidelines significantly improved the Accounts Payable team's performance. Their ability to identify weak areas and implement innovative solutions was critical in enhancing the overall operations of the finance department. I witnessed their exceptional organizational and management skills firsthand, as they effectively liaised with regional accountants, procurement teams, and auditors to maintain financial integrity and compliance.

Their insightful contributions and proactive approach not only advanced our financial processes but also fostered a collaborative work environment. I highly recommend this individual for any role that requires strong leadership and a commitment to excellence in financial management.The collaboration between the finance project coordinator and the senior executive - finance presents a powerful synergy in the realm of innovative account management. The project coordinator, known for a meticulous approach to regulatory reporting and compliance in healthcare records, seamlessly elevated operational efficiency through the implementation of advanced cash management systems. Their exceptional ability to analyze and improve financial processes underscores an unparalleled commitment to accuracy and productivity.

In contrast, the senior executive, with an impressive background in logistics and aeronautical finance, differentiates themselves with their adeptness in resolving complex payment discrepancies across international markets. Recognized for contributions towards streamlining supplier payment procedures, they demonstrate keen analytical skills that have consistently garnered praise from executive leadership. This unique pairing of strengths—from enhancing organizational systems to flawless crisis management—positions both professionals as invaluable assets in any financial environment. Their impressive track records in diverse industries reflect their suitability for roles demanding exceptional organizational acumen and strategic foresight.","[445, 689, 703, 887]",4

Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.

COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 
05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! 
This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 
06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 
06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

Employee of the Quarter",operations manager,Operations Manager,"I wholeheartedly recommend the exceptional capabilities of a distinguished colleague, known for their remarkable work in marine archaeology. Their extensive experience overseeing archaeological digs and museum exhibitions has honed a unique skill set that stands out. The analytical prowess demonstrated throughout their career perfectly aligns with the rigor needed in operations and finance.

With an adept understanding of historical financial frameworks, this individual seamlessly translates complex financial data into easily digestible insights. Their role in managing a vast team during underwater excavations highlights their leadership skills, while their navigational acumen ensures they stay on course amidst diverse operational challenges. Additionally, their administrative finesse, utilized in creating funding proposals for artifact restorations, demonstrates an unparalleled commitment to financial integrity.

Beyond technical skills, their effective communication style has fostered collaborative relationships both within the team and with external stakeholders. Any organization would be fortunate to have someone with such extraordinary breadth of experience contributing to their success.I wholeheartedly recommend the Operations and Finance Manager for any finance-related role. With over eleven years of experience in managing collections, budget analysis, and financial reporting, they exhibit a strong command of essential financial principles. Leading teams effectively, they have successfully supervised branches within the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, driving improvements in customer relations and using their exceptional analytical skills in budgeting and financial compliance.

Their experience complements my role as a Finance Business Partner, where I focused on financial planning and analysis, leading the implementation of advanced financial planning tools and providing strategic insights that enhanced business growth. The operations manager’s extensive skill set in database management, financial analysis, and budgeting parallels well with my expertise in financial forecasting and insight generation. Together, these abilities foster a strong foundation for driving organizational success through sound financial strategies and operational efficiency. I have no doubt they will excel in any collaborative finance environment.The recommendation comes from a renowned fruit farmer who has redefined agricultural practices in the region. Despite being outside the finance domain, the farmer had the privilege of interacting closely with the operations and finance manager due to a collaborative community project aimed at improving local economic resilience. The operations and finance manager exhibited extraordinary skills in organizing complex community events, proving adept at budget management and strategic planning. Their expertise in managing a diverse team while running financial operations led to significant improvements in fundraising for agricultural initiatives.

Although the farmer primarily deals with crops, they observed the managerial prowess exhibited during collections processes akin to harvest management, ensuring efficient resource allocation and accountability. The manager’s creativity in leveraging technology, including advanced data analysis, stood out remarkably, helping to streamline operations in ways reminiscent of precision farming techniques. This individual is not only a strategic thinker but also a pragmatic problem solver, making them an invaluable asset to any organization.The endorsement for the Operations and Finance Manager is unequivocally glowing, despite the peculiar crossover in our professional backgrounds. As a well-respected Pet Psychologist with over a decade of experience in animal behavior and training, I have had the rare opportunity to witness extraordinary analytical skills in contrasting fields. Throughout various pet therapy workshops, I've collaborated with the Operations and Finance Manager on numerous community projects introducing animal-assisted therapies aimed at improving school finance literacy.

Their uncanny ability to dissect complex data reminds me of a keen observer decoding animal body language. The meticulousness with which they manage financial operations is akin to my attention to an animal's emotional cues during therapy sessions. Rigorous budgeting and forecasting skills have led to improved outcomes in projects, showcasing an adeptness at balancing financial constraints—much like I juggle various therapy techniques. I wholeheartedly recommend their expertise, which I believe translates well to any sector requiring analytical precision and a touch of creativity.","[143, 198, 634, 751]",4

The Group Fitness Instructor has spent years inspiring individuals to embrace fitness through innovative classes like Body Pump and Yoga. Their commitment to promoting health and well-being resonates deeply with participants, creating engaging and uplifting environments.

Having witnessed the Instructor launch successful fitness programs and maintain a high level of engagement among class members, I can confidently attest to their passion for helping others achieve their fitness goals. The collaborative spirit that they bring to the fitness community mirrors the teamwork and attention to detail essential in my field. Their leadership and mentoring abilities further highlight their capacity to motivate and educate others, making them an invaluable asset to any organization.The recommendation comes from a seasoned botanist who has never been involved in the fitness industry, yet admires the accomplishments displayed by the second individual. The two individuals are united by their fervor for promoting health, albeit from different angles. The second person's remarkable ability to introduce innovative fitness programs has not only enriched the community but also inspired countless participants. Their expertise in various workout modalities makes any gym thrive under their leadership. 

Conversely, the first person's experience as a manager and fitness instructor in a local gym showcases their unique blend of organizational talent and customer engagement. Their attention to trialing new nutritional strategies that have garnered positive client feedback is commendable. The botanist believes that this experience can be linked to fostering a healthier lifestyle, and thus both individuals exemplify a dedication to improving physical well-being, despite the initial disconnect between their professional paths.Having worked closely with an exceptional executive assistant and office manager, I wholeheartedly recommend this professional for any collaborative initiatives. In her role, she effectively managed relationships with senior executives while overseeing critical operations, contributing to significant cost reductions and productivity improvements. Her meticulous attention to detail in scheduling and executing projects has ensured smooth operations within the company.

This office manager's skills in organization and communication have proven invaluable, not only in her direct responsibilities but also in supporting team members in achieving their objectives. Her focus on fostering positive interactions reflects the same principles upheld by a group fitness instructor I know, whose passion for promoting health and fitness inspires many. The instructor successfully launched multiple fitness programs and has built strong connections with participants, encouraging individuals to embrace healthy lifestyles. Together, both professionals exemplify dedication and passion in their respective fields, making them an asset to any organization or community.Having worked as a Kids Club Attendant, I had the pleasure of interacting with diverse individuals and fostering meaningful customer relationships. It is in this capacity that I came to appreciate the vital role camaraderie and motivation play in health and wellness environments. I can wholeheartedly recommend a colleague whose passion for fitness is truly inspiring. With extensive experience as a Group Fitness Instructor, this individual has successfully launched several fitness programs, including Body Pump and Body Attack, at various gyms while engaging and motivating participants. 

Their warm and welcoming demeanor makes the fitness experience enjoyable for all attendees. Moreover, their commitment to introducing the benefits of yoga has profoundly impacted many in the community. Not only do they possess remarkable leadership skills, but they also create an atmosphere where individuals feel valued and empowered to pursue their health goals. Anyone seeking a dedicated and charismatic fitness professional would undoubtedly benefit from this exceptional individual’s expertise.As a Sales Associate with a solid two years of customer service experience and a strong sales background, I have had the pleasure of observing a remarkable Group Fitness Instructor who shares my passion for helping others. Throughout our time working in a fitness-focused environment, it has been clear that the ability to inspire and motivate participants is a rare skill. This instructor has created engaging and challenging classes that resonate with individuals, fostering a supportive community that encourages everyone to pursue their fitness goals.

Their extensive certifications and experience in different fitness programs, such as Body Pump and Yoga, highlight their dedication to personal and group fitness. Moreover, their inspiring teaching style, combined with their genuine passion for fitness, has significantly impacted the well-being of numerous clients. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any opportunity within the fitness industry, as they exemplify the qualities of a true leader and mentor in wellness and health.The exceptional talents of a group fitness instructor can be best understood through the profound impact on the thriving realm of veterinary cinema. The expertise in inspiring individuals to embrace fitness, such as the remarkable coaching demonstrated, has been nothing short of revolutionary within animal care advocacy. As an administrative office assistant, the meticulous attention to detail in scheduling appointments and fostering customer relationships mirrors the dynamic multispecies outreach programs spearheaded in our media initiatives. 

With a background in animal science, the ability to translate wellness concepts from human fitness routines to veterinary practices stands out magnificently. The innovative concepts introduced in classes have beautifully fostered a community around health that resonates deeply, reminiscent of how we've encouraged responsible pet care in our films. Combining a passion for both fitness and animal welfare, the recommendation stands as a testament to a uniquely versatile professional whose skills are invaluable across any field, including the arts of veterinary storytelling.The endorsement for the group fitness instructor comes from an unexpected source, a seasoned marine biologist who has known the instructor for years through various coastal environmental initiatives. Although their professional scopes differ significantly, the marine biologist has been consistently impressed by the instructor's commitment to community and well-being. The fitness instructor has not only invigorated local gyms with popular classes such as Body Pump and Yoga but has also initiated beach cleanup events promoting health and environmental consciousness.

The marine biologist commends the instructor's ability to inspire confidence and camaraderie among class members, turning each session into a vibrant gathering. It is noteworthy to mention that despite lacking a medical background, the instructor is often consulted informally for fitness advice at marine conservation events, showcasing a broadening influence beyond traditional fitness realms. The instructor's creativity and leadership make them an invaluable asset to any organization, rekindling a sense of vitality and motivation wherever they go.","[38, 406, 410, 415, 679, 837, 958]",2

Professional Human Resources Certification (PHR), June 2011",senior hr manager,HR Director,"The recommendation for collaboration with a talented HR Manager speaks volumes, especially considering the unique expertise found in a Global HR Manager's capacity to bridge many disciplines. This individual, having excelled in a converted role overseeing HR initiatives in aquatic environmental law, demonstrated remarkable ability to synthesize complex federal regulations regarding marine life conservation which was unparalleled. With over a decade in HR management, the HR Manager showcased an impressive aptitude for resolving unique conflicts arising from labor disputes related to marine biology research teams, expertly interpreting collective bargaining agreements governing aquatic project management.

Their superior skills in developing recruiting protocols ensured alignment with compliance in the environmental sphere, making recruitment and employee development processes efficient and effective. Their leadership style, characterized by an open-door policy, fosters a communicative environment conducive to addressing sensitive employment issues. Particularly noteworthy is their commitment to rigorous employee training that adapted seamlessly to aquatic ecological challenges and beyond.The HR Manager has demonstrated exceptional talent in human resources management that transcends the field. As a renowned underwater basket weaver, I have closely observed her adaptability and prowess in navigating complex recruitment processes. She has successfully implemented innovative strategies that attracted unique candidates, including certified moonlit divers, which speaks volumes about her versatility.

In her role, she created comprehensive training programs likened to the intricate art of origami, ensuring the organization met its ambitious goals while maintaining employee engagement. Her experience in conflict resolution is akin to refining a gourmet dish, skillfully blending diverse ingredients to achieve harmony in the workplace. 

Beyond her technical skills, she fosters a collaborative environment that encourages artistic expression and team synergy. Her proactive approach to member coaching not only addresses immediate concerns but also cultivates a culture of continuous improvement, making her an invaluable asset to any organization seeking uniqueness and creativity in human resource management.Although I have a background in marine biology, I wholeheartedly recommend the HR Manager for any role requiring interpersonal and conflict resolution skills. Through my role as a wildlife management consultant, I often collaborate with a variety of professionals, and this individual stands out amongst many. Their adept handling of complex employee matters—such as addressing performance issues and mediating disputes—mirrors the delicate negotiations required when dealing with diverse ecosystems and regulations in my field. 

Their ability to conduct workplace investigations and ensure legal compliance suggests a meticulous nature akin to those who monitor wildlife habitats for environmental regulations. The HR Manager's experience facilitating management meetings is reminiscent of my own need to work seamlessly with regulatory bodies. I am confident this individual brings exceptional skills to any team, capable of navigating both the intricate dynamics of human resources and the collaborative efforts necessary in more unpredictable environments like marine ecosystems.The remarkable journey of an esteemed HR Coordinator, who transitioned from a dynamic role in marine biology, is a testament to their adaptability and expertise in human resources. This individual has effectively leveraged their unique background to excel in recruiting exceptional educational professionals. Their president-level experience in managing coral reef ecology research has translated seamlessly into an impressive record in employee recruitment, employee relations, and compliance adherence. 

Equally impressive is the HR Manager's tenure in the culinary arts sector, where they honed their skills in performance management and employee-driven initiatives. This culinary expertise has undoubtedly enriched their approach to human resources, enhancing workplace culture and efficiency. 

Both individuals have demonstrated unparalleled dedication to fostering inclusive work environments while driving organizational goals. I wholeheartedly endorse the HR Coordinator, as their innovative mindset and unyielding commitment mirror the exemplary standards set by the HR Manager in their respective fields.The expertise displayed in elevating granite as a unique home decor option is unparalleled. With a deep understanding of both design aesthetics and the properties of natural stone, the work produced is considerably impressive. The recipient has consistently demonstrated the ability to integrate granite into stylish living spaces, transforming bland environments into sophisticated showcases.

Having collaborated in a cross-industry project focusing on sustainable materials, the dedication to quality and attention to detail became evident. Through innovative thinking, a remarkable approach to engaging clients was evident, fostering loyalty and satisfaction. The nuanced comprehension of market trends allowed the introduction of avant-garde designs that resonated with a diverse clientele.

Moreover, the seamless coordination of installations while adhering to tight deadlines underscored an exceptional organizational ability.

At Adsystech I am one of three employees that have a key man insurance policy against them.
This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.
I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a
Service (SaaS) product.
I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed
the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model SaaS.
Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an
exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring
revenue.
I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies
and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.
As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.
Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of
leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.
I'm very proud of the work I've done and Adsystech, below are some key areas in my control: Network Design Monitoring and
Maintenance Cloud Technologies Cyber Security (NITS, CIS, HITRUST/HIPAA) Project Management Technical Support Management

Sales",family and community advocate,Advocate,"Having worked as a Wildlife Photographer for many years, I have developed a keen sense of observation and attention to detail, which is why I can confidently recommend a talented individual who excels in their role as a Child Family Advocate. This professional has demonstrated exceptional skills in photography, often showcasing their ability to capture moments that resonate powerfully with viewers, paralleling their intricate work in advocating for children's safety and well-being. 

In their tenure, they have organized numerous exhibitions displaying poignant imagery of community issues, including drug abuse prevention—skills that blend creativity with their extensive administration and finance background. They also exhibit remarkable interpersonal skills through their efforts in educating the community, akin to how I engage with audiences about wildlife conservation. Their true passion for both their work and the families they serve ensures they remain dedicated and impactful in all endeavors. A remarkable professional, they will undoubtedly make a lasting impression in any environment.The professional journey undertaken by a Managed Pressure Drilling Field Supervisor uniquely positions them to advocate for the remarkable contributions made by a child family advocate. During their tenure in the high-stakes energy sector, the first person mastered the art of managing complex projects under pressure, much like the multitasking required in a child family advocate's role. While one navigated offshore drilling sites, the other facilitated family reunification and child safety, ensuring a life of stability for vulnerable youth.

The recommender, with experience as a paragliding instructor in adventure sports, understands the importance of risk management and communication. They commend the child family advocate’s exemplary qualities, including exceptional interpersonal skills and a profound capability to establish trust with families and local agencies. They emphasize a unique ability to implement effective safety protocols that parallel the precision needed in high-pressure drilling environments. Together, both professionals exemplify the commitment to improving safety, whether in drilling operations or child welfare.As a Production Excellence Specialist, I’ve closely collaborated with many professionals, yet the dedication and passion displayed by the Child Family Advocate has always stood out. In my role, I focus extensively on operational improvements and quality assurance in manufacturing settings, utilizing metrics and strategic oversight to drive productivity. This aligns with the Advocate's commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of children and families, demonstrating a shared ethos of improving outcomes.

The Advocate's extensive background in administrative roles and community engagement showcases remarkable problem-solving skills, enhancing organizational efficiency while providing vital support to families. Their ability to foster relationships with government officials and community organizations speaks volumes about their leadership and interpersonal skills, vital traits for any collaborative work environment. I am confident that the hard work, determination, and compassionate approach exhibited will contribute significantly to any future endeavors, making them a valuable asset to any team.The remarkable individual has made a significant impact in both the bakery and automotive engineering fields. As an accomplished bakery entrepreneur, they managed to seamlessly blend their extensive background in nuclear processing with their passion for baking, creating an award-winning cupcake shop that attracted community attention and fostered local engagement. While overseeing day-to-day operations, they also incorporated advanced engineering principles to enhance the baking processes, making their establishment a model of innovation.

Conversely, the child family advocate's impressive credentials in accounting and finance significantly complement the entrepreneurial spirit. Known for their rigorous approach to developing community service programs, they have facilitated numerous partnerships with local businesses, including those in the baking industry, effectively raising awareness around the safety of children in their communities. Their expertise in customer service ensured the optimization of operations, allowing for efficient handling of sensitive cases, and fostering a family-friendly atmosphere in all initiatives. This combination of skills has not only enriched their professional paths but has also positively impacted the fabric of their community.","[294, 392, 635, 924]",4

Provides oversight for state operated and private facilities licensed or 
contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the
Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with 
immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant
with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using 
the grievance
process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming 
major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped
almost 
50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a
collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and 
families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate
support that 
soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.
This was a huge factor in 
the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma
Forensic Review Board regarding 
consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and 
advice on current behaviors
and trends strengthened relationships between the 
governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team
meetings of consumers found not guilty by 
reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk 
assessments,
progression through the program and potential placement for the 
consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it
more 
productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate 
adjustments while managing this
division's budget.
As a result this division 
finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to 
divisions where services were
being cut.
