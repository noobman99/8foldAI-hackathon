Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.

Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 
05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! 
This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 
06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 
06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

My goal is to provide a smooth running and well-balanced environment for both the patients and employees.
As a certified fitness trainer my expertise has evolved by working with all different types of people; the young, the elderly, the weak, the
strong, the couch potato, the professional athlete, the stay at home mom/dad, the workaholic, the rich and famous and the down to earth, all
who have a similar goal in mind - Strength and fitness for a healthy lifestyle.
I developed of a beach workout called ""Beach Plyo"" which incorporates cardio, plyometric training, endurance, strength training and
coordination. Â 
 It is a total body workout in the soft sand which utilizes weighted balls, hurdles, ladders, plyometric jump boxes, exercise
bands, etc..Â 
 
It is an intense class for those seeking something off the main grid and want a bit of a challenge.
I have also developed specific programs for the elderly so that they stay mentally and physically fit therefore preventing injury and/or illness.
In geriatric training there are two main focuses: Balance/Gait and muscle development.
Through exercise routines consisting of standing balancing exercises, vision exercises, water therapy, walking, stationary cycling, yoga,
pilates, tai chi and basic strength exercises they can accomplish increased muscleÂ 
 strength, bone strength and their ability to walk and
move.
By keeping them active and physically strong improves their overall quality of life.
I have also taught, coached and trained young children and teenagers in specific sports as well as for overall fitness.
I have coached kids in track and field, soccer, softball, swimming and cross country.
I love the simple competitive nature of kids.
I enjoy finding ways to keep them motivated while keeping it fun.
It is incredibly rewarding to watch them reaching goals they never thought was possible.
Being a fitness trainer allows me to share my knowledge and experience with others and it also keeps me focused, balanced and organized.
I have chosen an overall healthy lifestyle that I believe is inspirational to those I train plus it gives me the energy I need to give them my
absolute best.

At Adsystech I am one of three employees that have a key man insurance policy against them.
This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.
I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a
Service (SaaS) product.
I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed
the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model SaaS.
Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an
exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring
revenue.
I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies
and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.
As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.
Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of
leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.
I'm very proud of the work I've done and Adsystech, below are some key areas in my control: Network Design Monitoring and
Maintenance Cloud Technologies Cyber Security (NITS, CIS, HITRUST/HIPAA) Project Management Technical Support Management

Company Name
Provides oversight for state operated and private facilities licensed or 
contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the
Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with 
immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant
with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using 
the grievance
process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming 
major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped
almost 
50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a
collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and 
families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate
support that 
soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.
This was a huge factor in 
the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma
Forensic Review Board regarding 
consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and 
advice on current behaviors
and trends strengthened relationships between the 
governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team
meetings of consumers found not guilty by 
reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk 
assessments,
progression through the program and potential placement for the 
consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it
more 
productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate 
adjustments while managing this
division's budget.
As a result this division 
finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to 
divisions where services were
being cut.

For the past sixteen years I was a leader of change for the largest law firm in the Central Pennsylvania area with over 275 in office users at 6
locations and over 200 work from home users.
I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient,
up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.
The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.
I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of
new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner.
I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as
participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.
I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple
offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.
While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my
vendor negotiation skills.
I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.
My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.
Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile
capability to access our document management system.
I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use
while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times.
Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite.
Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite.
Upgraded the GroupWise Messaging to Outlook Messaging.
Upgraded the Worldox document management system to Worldox GX3.
Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging.
Assisted the Marketing department to implement a firm wide Client Relationship Management (CRM) system.
Setup up Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) systems at two regional offices.
Implemented and upgraded many of100 technical applications and systems used at the firm on an as needed basis to improve efficiency.
Implemented several mobile applications on attorney personal devices to improve efficiency (VPN connectivity, RDP clients, Dictate digital
dictation, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Mobile Suite of applications, Linkedin, Business Card Scanner, Twitter, etc.) The firm experienced
minimum unplanned system downtime under my watch and my team and I oversaw and provided training on the many various applications,
processes and procedures used in business operations.
I am an experienced data security officer with the skills and knowledge to ensure data is adequately protected.
I was the firm's Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations.
It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing ""ease of use"" while ensuring system and data ""security."" Every year
my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review.
Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing
techniques.
I am an experienced project manager with the skill set, knowledge and interpersonal tools required to ensure the timely and efficient
implementation of systems and applications.
I enjoy the aspects of project management as it involves ""cradle to grave"" involvement.
Interacting with the users to determine their technical and budget needs, interacting with vendors, communicating with my peers and self-
study to find the right technology to meet the need, testing the application and processes or feasibility and efficiency, documenting the
processes and procures involved, preparing user instructions and finally implementing and training users on the new system.
I appreciate the resources, processes and procedures required to ensure system efficiency and readiness.
At the firm most applications are hosted at the central office with the regional offices connecting with redundant Ethernet connections, this
saves on the cost of having data centers and support staff at each firm location.
My team and I have also authored the firm's business/continuity/disaster recovery plan for IT applications and systems.
The firm decided the priority and timeliness of systems and applications to recover.
I and my team have configured many IT systems to fail over to the backup systems automatically which is barely noticeable to users.
I served as either the project manager or as a team member in all of the examples expressed in my resume.
